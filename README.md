# FAX
A discord bot to mock my friends.

# Usage
- First change the dialogues in facts list.
- Create a new bot, add it to your guild and generate api token from [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications).  
- Make a file token.env and put in it, DISCORD_ENV={ your token }  (without curly brackets). 
- Now run the bot with python3 bot.py and it should say it has connected to discord.
- To run in background in a bash terminal use nohup python3 bot.py >/dev/null 2>&1. 
- You can now use the keyword 'spit fax' in your discord guild to trigger fax.
